Designed a system to allow integration of bikers with potential vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems of the future. Uses Pebble API to detect arm signals of bikers, and communicate with surrounding cars. This project simulates the communication between the biker's Pebble watch and on-board vehicle communication modules by using an Android application to represent the car's relevant status, and implementing a communication protocol via a python backend web service (which would be replaced with a direct communication protocol between the Pebble watch and on-board vehicle communication systems).
